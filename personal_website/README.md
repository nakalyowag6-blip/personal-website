# Personal Website - BLS3122 Practice

This is a ready-to-run responsive personal website built to satisfy the BLS3122 Web Document Management practice assignment.

## What's included
- `index.html` — the main page
- `styles.css` — styling (responsive)
- `assets/profile.svg` — profile image placeholder
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run locally
1. Unzip the project.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## How to host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `bls3122-personal-website`).
2. Upload the project files to the repository (push with git or upload zip contents).
3. In the repository settings, go to **Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` (or `gh-pages` branch if you prefer) and click **Save**.
5. GitHub will provide a link like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`. Paste that for grading.

## Notes
- Replace the placeholder profile image in `assets/profile.svg` with your photo (keep the same filename or update the `img` tag).
- Edit the content (education, experience, hobbies) in `index.html` to match your own details.

Good luck with your submission!
